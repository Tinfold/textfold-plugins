"""GitHub Copilot, as a textfold plugin.

Two halves, and they are worth telling apart because only one of them talks to
Copilot proper:

  * **Inline suggestions** are real. This bridges to `copilot-language-server`,
    which GitHub ships and which speaks the same JSON-RPC framing textfold's
    plugins do — so the plugin is mostly a translator between two protocols
    that already agree about how to move JSON down a pipe. It needs you signed
    in (`copilot/sign-in`) and a Copilot subscription.

  * **Chat** is a panel, and its backend is whatever you point it at. Copilot's
    language server has no conversation API — it does inline completions and
    nothing else — so there is nothing here to bridge to. The panel runs the
    command in `chat.command` and shows what comes back, which means it works
    with `gh copilot`, with a local model, or with anything that reads a
    question on the command line.

What this plugin exists to demonstrate is the editor's side: a plugin that
draws *into your text* rather than beside it, and one that holds a
conversation in a buffer of its own.

Written against textfold's plugin protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0, Content-Length
framing, on stdin and stdout.
